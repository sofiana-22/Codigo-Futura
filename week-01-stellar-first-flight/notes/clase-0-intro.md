\## What I Learned Today



Today was my introduction to blockchain and Stellar. I'm now part of the 0.1% who actually use this technology, not just read about it.



\### Key Concepts



\*\*Blockchain Basics:\*\*

\- It's like a giant shared notebook where thousands of people have the same copy

\- When someone makes a transaction, everyone updates their copy

\- Nobody can cheat because everyone verifies



\*\*Bitcoin vs Stellar:\*\*

\- Bitcoin: like the first cell phone - revolutionary but basic

\- Stellar: like the iPhone - designed to be useful, fast, and accessible

\- Bitcoin takes 10+ minutes and costs $5-50 per transaction

\- Stellar takes 3-5 seconds and costs $0.00001



\*\*Smart Contracts:\*\*

\- Programs that execute agreements automatically

\- Like a vending machine: you put money in, it gives you the product - no human needed

\- Bitcoin can't do this, but Stellar has Soroban for smart contracts



\*\*Web3:\*\*

\- Web1: static pages (read only)

\- Web2: dynamic content (Facebook, Instagram)

\- Web3: decentralized internet (I control my data and money)



\*\*Important Terms:\*\*

\- \*\*Hash:\*\* unique digital fingerprint for data (SHA-256)

\- \*\*Public Key:\*\* like my email - shareable (starts with G... in Stellar)

\- \*\*Private Key:\*\* like password + PIN + legal signature - NEVER share (starts with S...)

\- \*\*XLM:\*\* Stellar's native currency (Lumens)

\- \*\*Testnet:\*\* practice network with fake money

\- \*\*Mainnet:\*\* real network with real money

\## What I Did Today - Hands On



\### 1. Installed Freighter Wallet



\- Went to https://www.freighter.app

\- Added extension to Chrome

\- Created new wallet with strong password

\- \*\*Important:\*\* password only unlocks Freighter on THIS device



\### 2. Saved My Recovery Phrase



\- Got 12 words - this is THE MASTER KEY

\- Wrote them on paper (no screenshots!)

\- Stored in safe place

\- \*\*CRITICAL:\*\* If I lose this, I lose everything in Mainnet



\### 3. Switched to Testnet



\- Clicked network selector in Freighter

\- Changed from "Mainnet" to "Testnet"

\- Now showing 0 XLM balance



\### 4. Funded My Account with Friendbot



\- Copied my public address (starts with G...)

\- Went to https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test

\- Pasted address in "Account Address"

\- Clicked "Get test network lumens"

\- Waited 2-3 seconds

\- \*\*Success!\*\* Now have 10,000 XLM in testnet



My first blockchain account is live! üéâ

\## Technical Understanding



\*\*How Stellar Works:\*\*



\*\*Consensus - Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP):\*\*

\- 88 independent validator organizations

\- No mining competition (unlike Bitcoin)

\- Validators collaborate, not compete

\- Finality in 3-5 seconds

\- Environmentally sustainable



\*\*Why Fees Are So Low:\*\*

\- Base fee: 0.00001 XLM (always fixed)

\- No mining race = no wasted electricity

\- Optimized for payments specifically

\- Fees prevent spam, not to enrich validators



\*\*Security:\*\*

\- Public/Private key cryptography (Ed25519)

\- Blockchain immutability - can't change past blocks

\- 88 decentralized validators

\- 11+ years running without major interruptions

\## Stellar vs Others



| Feature | Bitcoin | Ethereum | Stellar |

|---------|---------|----------|---------|

| Speed | 10+ min | 12-15 sec | 3-5 sec |

| Cost | $5-50 | $15-50 | $0.00001 |

| TPS | 7 | 15 | 118 |

| Smart Contracts | No | Yes (Solidity) | Yes (Rust/Soroban) |

| Purpose | Digital gold | World computer | Global payments |

| Finality | ~60 min | ~15 min | 3-5 sec |



\*\*Why Stellar for this course:\*\*

\- Native Layer 1 security (not inherited)

\- Ultra-low predictable fees

\- Instant finality

\- Simple developer experience

\- Built for financial inclusion

\## Important Security Notes



\*\*On Testnet (where I am now):\*\*

\- ‚úÖ Experiment freely

\- ‚úÖ Share public addresses

\- ‚úÖ Practice good habits

\- ‚úÖ Don't worry about mistakes



\*\*On Mainnet (real money):\*\*

\- ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER share 12-word phrase

\- ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER share private key

\- ‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS verify addresses

\- ‚ö†Ô∏è Start with small amounts

\- ‚ö†Ô∏è Transactions are IRREVERSIBLE
