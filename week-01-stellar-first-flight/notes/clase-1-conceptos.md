\## New Concepts: The 4 Pillars of Stellar



\### 1. LEDGER

A new "page" closes every 3-5 seconds with all transactions in it. Once written, immutable forever. Like a global accounting book that never stops.



\### 2. ACCOUNTS

Two-key system I already know (public G... / secret S...), but now understanding the account structure better.



\### 3. ASSETS

\*\*XLM (Lumens):\*\* Native currency, used for fees, no permission needed to receive



\*\*Custom Tokens (like USDC):\*\* Need "trustline" first

\- Trustline = saying "I trust this issuer, I accept their token"

\- Like giving permission before someone can send you their custom money



\### 4. TRANSACTIONS

Signed messages with:

\- Source + Destination accounts

\- Amount + Asset type

\- Memo (optional message)

\- Fee (0.00001 XLM)

\- Digital signature

\## What I Did Today



\### Created Second Account

\- In Freighter: "Create Account" â†’ named it "Account 2"

\- Copied public address

\- Funded with Friendbot â†’ 10,000 XLM

\- Now have 2 accounts ready



\### My First Transaction! ðŸŽ‰



\*\*Sent 500 XLM: Account 1 â†’ Account 2\*\*



Process:

1\. Freighter â†’ "Send"

2\. Destination: Account 2 address

3\. Amount: 500 XLM

4\. Memo: "My first transaction as Tiburona Builder! ðŸ¦ˆ"

5\. Reviewed: destination âœ“, amount âœ“, fee 0.00001 XLM âœ“

6\. Confirmed

7\. \*\*3-5 seconds later: SUCCESS\*\*



\*\*Result:\*\*

\- Account 1: 9,499.99999 XLM

\- Account 2: 10,500 XLM



\### Explored on StellarExpert



https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet



\*\*What I saw:\*\*

\- Operation: Payment

\- Amount: 500 XLM

\- Fee: 0.00001 XLM

\- Source/Destination accounts

\- My custom memo message

\- Transaction hash (unique ID)

\- Ledger number (which "page" it's on)

\- Timestamp

\- Status: Success âœ…



\*\*Everything is public and verifiable - this is transparency.\*\*

\## How Transactions Actually Work



1\. I create transaction (signed with my secret key)

2\. Broadcast to Stellar network

3\. Validators verify:

&nbsp;  - Do I have enough funds?

&nbsp;  - Is signature valid?

&nbsp;  - Am I trying to double-spend?

4\. Gets included in next ledger (3-5 sec)

5\. Permanently recorded

6\. IRREVERSIBLE

\## Key Insight



\*\*Real-world example they showed:\*\*

Sending $1,000 Argentina â†’ Japan

\- Traditional: 3-5 days, $75-95 lost in fees

\- Stellar: 3-5 seconds, $0.00001 fee



\*\*This matters for:\*\*

\- 1.7 billion unbanked people

\- Remittances (family money transfers)

\- Micropayments now viable

\- Financial inclusion

\## Tools Used



\- \*\*Freighter:\*\* Send/receive interface

\- \*\*Friendbot:\*\* Free testnet XLM

\- \*\*StellarExpert:\*\* Blockchain explorer (like Google for transactions)

\## What's Next



Now I can send basic payments. Next: working with different assets and trustlines.



\*\*Transaction count:\*\* 1 âœ…
